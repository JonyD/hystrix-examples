This tutorial just got a sister.
It is on making services work in the cloud, so this makes it similar to Hystrix. 
But it is not about resilience, but about deployment, configuration management and service discovery. 

Have a look at the [Example Project for Terraform, Salt, Consul and DigitalOcean](https://github.com/ahus1/saltconsul-examples) and let me know what you think.
