I've presented my Hystrix talk at the [JavaLand](http://www.javaland.eu/javaland-2015/) conference. I used the chance to review the examples and update them to the latest Hystrix 1.4 release. 

There have been hardly any changes to the code: a good sign that Hystrix is a mature product.

I've tested the virtual machines for Zabbix and Riemann. The Riemann-VM needed some touches after the Ruby Version Manager (RVM) changed.

So you are ready to try it out yourself. The new slides are available on [Speakerdeck](https://speakerdeck.com/ahus1/robuste-anwendungen-mit-hystrix).
