The first version is online in the [github repo][hystrixsamples-gh]. You'll see an example application, load tests and a realtime dashboard.

Stay tuned for the integration of Zabbix and Riemann. The code is already there, but I want to add a Vagrant box for each of them soon. 

But now it's time for me to prepare the slides for the upcoming talks...
